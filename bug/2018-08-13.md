# [What does “connection reset by peer” mean?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1434451/what-does-connection-reset-by-peer-mean)

What is the meaning of the "connection reset by peer" error on a TCP connection? Is it a fatal error or just a notification or related to the network failure?

我的问题: 今天批量上传文件会出现这个问题, 请求太频繁azure会抛弃一些tcp等待的包
``` python
    for filepath in files:
        if not os.path.exists(filepath):
            missed_file.append(filepath)
            continue
        s = os.path.basename(filepath)
        (shotname, extension) = os.path.splitext(s)
        m = hashlib.md5()
        m.update(filepath)
        md_hash = m.hexdigest()
        blob_name =  md_hash + '_' +shotname+extension
        print storage_path + blob_name,filepath
        time.sleep(0.2)
        blockblob_service.create_blob_from_path(_AZURE_CONTAINER, os.path.join(storage_path + blob_name), filepath)
        result['files'][md_hash] = _AZURE_FILE_PREFIX + _AZURE_CONTAINER + '/' + os.path.join(storage_path + blob_name)
        result['url'].append(_AZURE_FILE_PREFIX + _AZURE_CONTAINER + '/' + os.path.join(storage_path + blob_name))
```

It's fatal. The remote server has sent you a RST packet, which indicates an immediate dropping of the connection, rather than the usual handshake. This bypasses the normal half-closed state transition. I like [this description](http://everything2.com/title/Connection+reset+by+peer):

> "Connection reset by peer" is the TCP/IP equivalent of slamming the phone back on the hook. It's more polite than merely not replying, leaving one hanging. But it's not the FIN-ACK expected of the truly polite TCP/IP converseur.
